# Welcome to ruboerner.github.io 🌍

This site hosts my academic and teaching materials related to **applied geophysics**, 
with a particular focus on **potential theory** and **electromagnetic methods** in geophysics.

Here you’ll find lecture notes, examples, and supporting code for university-level courses and research topics.



## 📘 Lectures

### [Potential Theory](https://github.com/ruboerner/Potentia_Theory)
Materials and notes on the mathematical foundations of potential theory, including:
- Gravitational and magnetostatic potentials  
- Harmonic functions and Laplace’s equation  
- Boundary-value problems and Green’s functions  
- Applications in geophysics

### [Theory of Electromagnetic Methods](https://github.com/ruboerner/ThEM)
Lecture resources exploring the theoretical background of electromagnetic techniques in geophysical exploration:
- Maxwell’s equations and field propagation  
- Quasi-static approximations  
- Inductive and galvanic methods  
- Forward and inverse modelling concepts



## 🧮 Code Examples and Computational Tools




## 🌐 About the Site

This repository (`ruboerner.github.io`) serves as the landing page for my GitHub projects.  
The lecture sites are built using **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** and **Markdown/Quarto** to provide a clear overview of my teaching and research materials.
